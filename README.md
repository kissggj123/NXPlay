# NXPlay - check (the latest release)[https://github.com/XorTroll/NXPlay/releases/latest]
Multimedia player for Nintendo Switch (audio only, video soon)
- Place MP3, WAV, OGG, MOD or FLAC audios at ```sdmc:/switch/nxplay``` and enjoy!
- Controls info is on the app itself.
- I'm working on a ffmpeg port to make videos also available.
